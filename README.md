## Paper Overview
This paper accompanies the CHI ’25 publication titled **"Scrolling in the Deep: Analysing Contextual Influences on Intervention Effectiveness during Infinite Scrolling on Social Media"**. It investigates how various contextual factors influence the effectiveness of interventions implemented during infinite scrolling on social media platforms. By employing a combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses, the study provides insights into user behavior and the dynamics of intervention strategies. The work offers design implications aimed at enhancing user experience and promoting healthier interaction patterns on social media. The study was presented at the CHI ’25 conference, held from April 26 to May 1, 2025, in Yokohama, Japan.
